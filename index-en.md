## Research Experience

In the third year of undergraduate studies, I participated in the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications extra-curricular academic science and technology works competition, carrying out the design and prototyping of a small rescue robot, responsible for the machine vision part of it. The work won the third prize at the university level and was granted a national patent.

In my fourth year of undergraduate studies, I joined the Research Laboratory of Fusion Imaging and Intelligent Processing Applications, Institute of Electro-Optical Microsystems, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, working on projects related to low-light image enhancement and its development. Since joining, I have reproduced various low-light image enhancement algorithms based on digital image processing using MATLAB; using self-taught deep learning algorithms, I led a team to combine with deep learning to propose a more effective low-light enhancement method in my graduation design "Research on Low-light Image Enhancement Algorithm", which was further improved and submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, which is currently under review.
